# DataStructures and Algorithms
### Data Structures
1. Double-linked list
    - List where, every node has previous and next fields, which has pointers to next/previous node in list. Such structure allows you to easly iterate in both directions from the end and from the beginning.
    - Time complexity:

      |Access|Search|Insertion|Deletion|
      |:----:|:----:|:-------:|:------:|
      |O(n)  | O(n) | O(1)    | O(1)   |
    
### Algorithms
1. Huffman coding
    - –ê class that allows you to encode messages using the Huffman compression algorithm. This class also allows you to draw Huffman-tree (using graphviz).
    - Time complexity:

      |Access|Search|Insertion|Deletion|
      |:----:|:----:|:-------:|:------:|
      |Nan   | Nan  | Nan     | Nan    |
